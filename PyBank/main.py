description: In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
-> The total number of months included in the dataset
-> The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-> The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
-> The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-> The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
